Within this dataset I used the following functions Length(),Trim()

### Pulled customer Id from dataset which returned three duplicates

select
customer_id
from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`


### Pulled unique customer id by using the Distinct query which will only pull one of each customer id

Select DISTINCT
customer_id
From `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`


### Pulled customer name and city Data from dataset

SELECT 
name,
city
FROM `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address` 
  
  

### Inserted updated customer address into dataset

INSERT INTO  `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data customer_address`
(customer_id, address, city, state, zipcode, country)
Values 
(2645,`333 SQL Road`,`Jackson`,`MI`, 49202, `US`)


### Updated specific customer address

update `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`
set address = `123 New Address`
where customer_id =2645


### Length to make sure text strings are consistent to remind myself what the results where I labeled the column as 

select
length(country) AS letters_in_country
from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`

### Almost all text strings were consistent of 2 letters except for one that came back as three letters

### The following query returned the text strings within the country column that were greater than two which returned two results that 
were labeled as `USA` instead of `US`

select
country
from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`
where length(country)>2


### Used the substring function to return first two letter of each country

select distinct
customer_id
from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`
where substr(country,1,2) =`US`



### Returned state column to see if there are any state text string greater than two. Which returned one state `OH `. 
There is 2 characters, but it still returned when I ran the query which means it must have a space.

select
state
from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`
where length(state)>2



### I used the trim function to eliminate the space with the text string to make sure that the string variables are consistent and 
complete to avoid errors or miscalculations select distinct customer_id

from `customer-dataset-358511.Customer_Data.customer_address`
where trim(state) =`OH`
