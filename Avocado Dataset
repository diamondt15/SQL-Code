Avocado SQL coding

### Pulling certain columns from the dataset
SELECT 
date,
region,
small_bags,
large_bags,
XLarge_Bags,
total_bags
FROM `avocado-dataset-358600.avocado_data.avocado_prices`


### Adding columns together and giving them a new column
SELECT 
date,
region,
small_bags,
large_bags,
XLarge_Bags,
total_bags
Small_Bags + Large_Bags + Xlarge_Bags AS Total_Bags_Calc
FROM `avocado-dataset-358600.avocado_data.avocado_prices`


### Finding the percentage of small bags and giving the results a new column
SELECT 
date,
region,
total_bags,
small_bags,
(small_bags/total_bags)*100 AS small_bags_percent
FROM `avocado-dataset-358600.avocado_data.avocado_prices`
 

### The results returned as an error because there is a total of bags that equals 0. To fix this problem I ran the following code 
to run a query that doesnâ€™t equal to 0. 

SELECT 
date,
region,
total_bags,
small_bags,
(small_bags/total_bags)*100 AS small_bags_percent
FROM `avocado-dataset-358600.avocado_data.avocado_prices`
Where total_bags <> 0
